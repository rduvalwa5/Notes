I am not sure I understood the xml submitting part in your question. However, I can tell you an example which 
will help to you understand how to submit the tests to grid.
Three people, PersonA, PersonB and PersonC are creating selenium tests in their local machine. 
They currently run the test using an ANT build (or something similar) against the selenium server jar 
which is in their local machine. In their code they would be having a line of code which tells which selenium instance 
should be used to run this test. This will be mostly like

new DefaultSelenium("localhost",port,browsername,URL)
Now these people want to move to selenium grid (1 or 2). Here is what they will have to do to use the grid

All they have to do is change the command

new DefaultSelenium("localhost",port,browsername,URL)
to

new DefaultSelenium("hubIPAddress",portInWhichHubWasStarted,browsername,URL)
Note:- browserName - Make sure there is a remote node registered in Hub for the same browserName.

Now all the commands will be sent to Selenium Hub and Hub would execute the commands using the remote nodes.

Hope this helps. Please post if you have any questions.
