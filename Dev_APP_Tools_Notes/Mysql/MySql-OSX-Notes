Post-Installation Notes
You have successfully installed the Subversion 1.6.13 universal binary for OS X Snow Leopard (10.6).  Please remember to prepend /opt/subversion/bin to your PATH environment variable.  This can be done a multitude of ways but an easy one is to add the following to the end of ~/.profile:

export PATH=/opt/subversion/bin:$PATH

If you plan on running an Apache-based Subversion server, you will also need to prepend the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable in /usr/sbin/envvars with /opt/subversion/lib so that the Subversion libraries shipped with this binary are used instead of those supplied by the operating system.  Here is an example snippet of what /usr/sbin/envvars might look like after making these changes:

...
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/subversion/lib:/usr/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
...

You will also need to update the SSL portion of your httpd.conf if you're using SSL:

SSLProtocol ALL -SSLv2 -TLSv1

What this does is disable SSL v2 and TLS which would force SSLv3.  The reason for this is to work around a bug in the OpenSSL library shipped with OS X.
