Creating and exchanging public and private keys

1) On the server that will be logged onto
	1.  $ ssh-keygen
	Generating RSA keys:  Key generation complete.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/rduval/.ssh/identity): redkey
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
	Enter same passphrase again:
	Your identification has been saved in redkey.
	Your public key has been saved in redkey.pub.
	The key fingerprint is:
	fa:24:30:34:99:4f:41:6b:c6:c9:ef:fd:fe:a2:d6:83 rduval@C1246895-U.mshome.net
	$ ls
	code            redkey          redkey.pub
	$ pwd
	/home/rduval

2) FTP or copy public key from server that is going to be logged onto to the server that will
be initiating the log on.
Create a .ssh directory to put the public key into


3)  test the access by: ssh <user on server to access>@<server>

C:\Documents and Settings\RDuval\.ssh>ssh rduval@c1246895-u
rduval@c1246895-u's password:
