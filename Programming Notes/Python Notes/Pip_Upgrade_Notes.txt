Installing Packages
This section covers the basics of how to install Python packages.

It’s important to note that the term “package” in this context is being used as a synonym for a distribution 
(i.e. a bundle of software to be installed), not to refer to the kind of package that you import in your 
Python source code (i.e. a container of modules). It is common in the Python community to refer to a distribution 
using the term “package”. Using the term “distribution” is often not preferred, because it can easily be confused 
with a Linux distribution, or another larger software distribution like Python itself.
