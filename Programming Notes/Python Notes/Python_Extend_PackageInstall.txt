Adding Python Drivers:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Getting a Mysql driver for Python 3.4
    4.1 Installing Connector/Python from a Binary Distribution
	4.2 Installing Connector/Python Source Distribution on Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X
	4.3 Installing Connector/Python Source Distribution on Microsoft Windows
	4.4 Verifying Your Connector/Python Installation
	1. MySQL Links:
	http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-installation.html
	Python Connector http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/
	-  C1246895-WIN64  C:\Users\Randall Duval\Downloads\mysql-connector-python-1.2.3-py3.3.msi

 4.3 Installing Connector/Python Source Distribution on Microsoft Windows
		a. download Connector/Python as a Zip archive from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/
           Make sure that the Python executable is available in the Windows %PATH% setting
		b. For more information about installation and configuration of Python on Windows, 
		   see the section Using Python on Windows in the Python documentation
    2. To install Connector/Python from the .zip file, download the latest version and follow these steps:
			1. To use a Zip archive, unpack it in the intended installation directory 
			  (for example, C:\mysql-connector\) using WinZip or another tool that can read .zip files.
            2. Start a console window (or a DOS window) and change location to the folder where you unpacked the Connector/Python Zip archive:
			   shell> cd C:\mysql-connector\
			3. Inside the Connector/Python folder, perform the installation using this command:
			   shell> python setup.py install
	3. On Windows, Connector/Python is installed in the default location 
	   C:\PythonX.Y\Lib\site-packages\ where X.Y is the Python version you used to install the connector.
       If you are not sure where Connector/Python was installed, do the following to determine the location:
		shell> python
		>>> from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib
		>>> print get_python_lib()            # Python v2.x
		>>> print(get_python_lib())           # Python v3.x
	4. Location C:\Python33\Lib\site-packages\mysql\connector
	
 4.2 Installing Connector/Python Source Distribution on Linux, Unix, or Mac OS XChapter 4 Connector/Python Installation
	On Unix-like systems such as Linux distributions, Solaris, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD, 
	1. download Connector/Python as a tar archive from:
	   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/
	2. sudo mv /Users/rduvalwa2/downloads/mysql-connector-python-2.0.1.tar /opt 
	3. cd /opt
    4. sudo tar xvf mysql-connector-python-2.0.1.tar 
    5. cd /opt/mysql-connector-python-2.0.1
    6. c1246895-osx:mysql-connector-python-2.0.1 rduvalwa2$ ls
		CHANGES.txt	LICENSE.txt	MANIFEST.in	PKG-INFO	README.txt	docs		examples	lib		setup.py	
		setupinfo.py	tests		unittests.py
	7. c1246895-osx:mysql-connector-python-2.0.1 rduvalwa2$ sudo python3 setup.py install
		byte-compiling /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/mysql/connector/version.py to version.cpython-34.pyc
		running install_egg_info
		Writing /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/mysql_connector_python-2.0.1-py3.4.egg-info
	8. Test for install find install location:

B. Using Pyhton Mysql connector:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-examples.
	These coding examples illustrate how to develop Python applications and scripts which connect to MySQL Server using MySQL Connector/Python.

To install Connector/Python from the .tar.gz file, download the latest version and follow these steps:
---------------------------------------------------	
   1.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23376103/python-3-4-0-with-mysql-database
		Summary:
		MySQLdb does not support Python 3 but it is not the only MySQL driver for Python.
		You can try using PyMySQL,http://www.pymysql.org/. 
		It is a pure python MySQL driver, which means it is slower, 
		but it does not require a compiled C component or MySQL libraries and 
		header files to be installed on client machines. 
		The latest version on pypi, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyMySQL,
		0.6.2, has Python 3.4 support.
        Another option is simply to use another database system like PostgreSQL.

		2. Install pip https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip   A tool for installing and managing Python packages.
			Quickstart - install pip https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html
			Installation
			Python & OS Support
				pip works with CPython versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and also pypy.
				pip works on Unix/Linux, OS X, and Windows.
			Note
			Python 2.5 was supported through v1.3.1, and Python 2.4 was supported through v1.1.
			Install pip
				To install or upgrade pip, securely download get-pip.py.
				(download and move file to $PYTHON_HOME
					Then run the following (which may require administrator access):
					python get-pip.py
					C:\Python34>python get-pip.py
						Requirement already up-to-date: pip in c:\python34\lib\site-packages
						Cleaning up...
					C:\Python34>
****** Issue downloading https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/tarball/  getting curl and ssh to work
$ # X.X is the desired PyMySQL version (e.g. 0.5 or 0.6).
$ curl -L https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/tarball/pymysql-X.X | tar xz
$ cd PyMySQL*
$ python setup.py install
$ # The folder PyMySQL* can be safely removed now.

		2.  http://www.pymysql.org/
       Requirements
		Python -- one of the following:
        CPython >= 2.6 or >= 3.3
			PyPy >= 2.0
			IronPython 2.7
		MySQL Server -- one of the following:
			MySQL >= 4.1
			MariaDB >= 5.1
			
		Installation
		The last stable release is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:
		$ pip install PyMySQL
		Alternatively (e.g. if pip is not available), a tarball can be downloaded from GitHub and installed with Setuptools:
		$ # X.X is the desired PyMySQL version (e.g. 0.5 or 0.6).
		$ curl -L https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/tarball/pymysql-X.X | tar xz
		$ cd PyMySQL*
		$ python setup.py install
		$ # The folder PyMySQL* can be safely removed now.
