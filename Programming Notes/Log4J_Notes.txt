1) Log4j consists of four main components
	– LogManager
	– Loggers
	– Appenders
	– Layouts
	
2) Java Imports
	import org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator;
	import org.apache.log4j.LogManager;
	import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
	
3) Logger	
	//mainLogger is a logger object that we got from LogManager. All loggers are 
    //using this method only. We can consider LogManager as a factory to create
    //Logger objects
	static Logger mainLogger = LogManager.getLogger(SampleEntry.class.getName());
	
4) Create Test with Logging simple example:
	1) Create a new XML file – log4j.xml
	   place it under the Project root folder and Paste the following code in the log4j.xml file
