B) The name POI was originally an acronym for Poor Obfuscation Implementation, referring humorously to 
the fact that the file formats seemed to be deliberately obfuscated, but poorly, since they were successfully reverse-engineered.

1) Apache POI classes start with HSSF, XSSF or SXSSF
	- 	HSSF is the POI Project’s pure Java implementation of the Excel ’97(-2007) file format. e.g. HSSFWorkbook, HSSFSheet.
	-	XSSF is the POI Project’s pure Java implementation of the Excel 2007 OOXML 
		(.xlsx) file format. e.g. XSSFWorkbook, XSSFSheet.
	-	SXSSF (since 3.8-beta3) is an API-compatible streaming extension of XSSF 
			to be used when very large spreadsheets have to be produced and heap space is limited
			e.g. SXSSFWorkbook, SXSSFSheet. SXSSF achieves its low memory footprint by limiting access to the rows that 
			are within a sliding window, while XSSF gives access to all rows in the document.
