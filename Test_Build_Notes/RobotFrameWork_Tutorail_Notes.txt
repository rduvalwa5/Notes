	test data
	- simple, easy-to-edit tabular format
	
	When Robot Framework is started
		- it processes the test data
		- executes test cases 
		- generates logs and reports
		
	core framework does not know anything about the target under test
		- interaction with it is handled by test libraries
		
	Libraries
		- either use application interfaces directly 
		- or use lower level test tools as drivers

1a  Test Case Syntax
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2.2.1   Test case syntax
	Basic syntax
	Test case construct test case tables from the available keywords
	Keywords imported from:
	 2.4	test libraries		http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#using-test-libraries
	 2.7.1	resource files		http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#resource-files
	 2.6	created in the keyword table of the test case file itself
	 					http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-user-keywords
	 2.6.5  Key word return values User keyword return values	http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#user-keyword-return-values 				
	 					

	TEST CASE TABLE
	- first column in the test case table contains test case names
		- test case starts from the row with something in this column 
		      continues to the next test case name 
	    	  or to the end of the table
		It is an error to have something between the table headers and the first test

	- second column has keyword names
	    - exception to this rule is setting variables from keyword return values
	      when the second and possibly also the subsequent columns contain variable names and a keyword name is located after them
	      In either case, columns after the keyword name contain possible arguments to the specified keyword.

	Example test cases 
	_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
	
	Test Case 			Action 	                      Argument 			Argument
	|------------------|------------==-------------|---------------|------------------------|
	   Valid Login 		 Open Login Page 	  	 
	|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|------------------------|
	|				   |  Input Name 		       |  demo 	       |------------------------|
	|                  |  Input Password 	       |  mode 	       |------------------------|
	|                  | Submit Credentials        | 	     	   |------------------------|	 
	|                  |Welcome Page Should Be Open|               |                        |   
	|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|------------------------|
	|Setting Variables | Do Something 	           |first argument |  second argument       |
	|                  |${value} = 	               |Get Some Value |                        |	
	|                  |Should Be Equal            | ${value}      |  Expected value        |
	|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|------------------------|


	Settings in the Test Case table
	_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  	Test cases can have their own settings
		 - Setting names always in the second column, where keywords normally are
	   		their values are in the subsequent columns
	 
	 	- Setting names have square [brackets around them] to distinguish them from keywords
			available settings are listed below and explained later in this section.

		[Documentation]    	Used for specifying a test case documentation.
		[Tags]				Used for tagging test cases.
		[Setup], [Teardown] Specify test setup and teardown. Have also synonyms [Precondition] and [Postcondition], respectively.
		[Template]			Specifies the template keyword to use. The test itself will contain only data to use as arguments to that keyword.
		[Timeout]			Used for setting a test case timeout. Timeouts are discussed in their own section.

		Example test case with settings 
		------------------------------------------------------------------------
		|  Test Case 	    |   Action 	     |Argument          |	Argument   |
		------------------------------------------------------------------------
    	|Test With Settings |[Documentation] |Another dummy test|              |
    	------------------------------------------------------------------------
		|                   | [Tags] 	     | dummy 	        |owner-johndoe |
		------------------------------------------------------------------------
		|                   | Log 	         |Hello, world!     |              |
		------------------------------------------------------------------------	
		
	Test case related settings in the Setting table
	_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

	Setting table can have the following test case related settings
		These settings are mainly default values for the test case specific settings listed earlier

	- Force Tags, Default Tags		The forced and default values for tags.
									http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#tagging-test-cases
	- Test Setup, Test Teardown		The default values for test setup and teardown. Have also synonyms Test Precondition and Test Postcondition, respectively.
									http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#test-setup-and-teardown
	- Test Template					The default template keyword to use.
									http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#test-templates
	- Test Timeout					The default value for test case timeout. Timeouts are discussed in their own section.

2.2.2   Using arguments
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


2.4	Using test libraries
	This section explains how to take test libraries into use and how to use the keywords they provide.
	Creating test libraries is described in a separate section.

	Test libraries contain lowest-level keywords
		- called library keywords
		- actually interact with the system under test
	All test cases always use keywords from some library
		- often through higher-level user keywords



2.6   Creating user keywords

2.6.5   User keyword return values

2.7.1   Resource files

Robot Framework Tutorial – A complete example
https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2012/04/robot-framework-tutorial-a-complete-example/

I.  Robot Framework Tutorial – Overview
 a. What means keyword-driven testing?
	Whenever I try to explain what a keyword is, I refer to it as a function or method that can be used to test (or help test) 
	one (smaller or bigger) aspect of the SuT (“System under Test”, that is how we call the tested system to be a bit more cool ;-)).

	The really cool – and really powerful – thing about this now is that one keyword can be defined from other keywords and so on. 
	That is why we are often talking of:

	Higher-level keywords: 
	Those are really testing a concrete aspect of the business logic of the system under test.

	Lower-level keywords: 
	To keep the implementation of the higher-level keywords at a decent size one is often breaking down the required 
	functionality to several lower-level keywords.

	Technical keywords: 
	Those provide the technical implementation to access and thus test the system.
	
	Keyword,,Test Function 1''
	|   Input: A,B,C
	|   Expected Result: X
	|
	|--> Keyword,,Update Input Table''
	|		Input: A,B,C
	|		Expected Result: ok/nok
	|               |		
	|               |--> Keyword..Connect To DB''
	|               |       Input: Connection-String
	|               |       Expected Result: ok/nok
	|               |
	|               |-->  Keyword,,Insert To Table''
	|               |       Input: Table-Name,x
	|               |       Expected Result: ok/nok
	|               |
	|               |--> ...
	|
	|--> Keyword,,Execute Batch''
	|      Input:Process-Name
	|      Expected Result: ok/nok
	|
	|--> Keyword,,Check Result''
	       Input: x
	       Expected Result: ok/nok
	       
	technical keywords are written in any programming language (ok, not really any)
	other keywords are then written as a combination of already existing keywords	
	look at a concrete definition of some keyword:
	       __________________________________________________________________________________
	       | Google Search    | [Arguments]        | ${SEARCH_ARG}        | ${RESULT_ARG}    |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|
	       |                  | Input Text         | q                    |  ${SEARCH_ARG}   |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|
	       |                  | Sleep              | 2s                   |                  |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|
	       |                  | Click Button       | btnG                 |  don't wait      |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|	       
	       |                  |Page should contain | ${RESULT_ARG}        |                  |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|
	       |                  |Capture Screenshot  |                      |                  |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|	 	       

	This shows:
		- definition of a keyword for a Google Search 
		- using keywords from the Selenium Library
	This leads us to the fact that there are already a lot of predefined keywords defined in so called Test Libraries.

 b.	Installation of Robot Framework 
 	- get the core framework and a set of Standard Test Libraries, bundled with the core installation
    - Standard Test Libraries and a lot of additional external Test Libraries
      contributed by the Robot Framework community and serve different purposes
    - good thing on all this libraries 
       you can mix all the keywords from all the different libraries together in defining your own keywords
       you can for example easily write tests for a web application using keywords from the Selenium Library 
       to remote control the web frontend and use at the same time the Database Library to check results of certain 
       operations from the database
    - ideal case all this can be done without a need to do any “real coding”, but by combining existing keywords from 
      existing libraries to high-level keywords

################################################################################################################################
Z.  Python Robot Framework Tutorial (This is primarily a Python Tutorial)

1) Introduction	
	- This is self learning material to learn how to program using Python language.http://python.org/
	  The target is to learn enough Python to be able to start creating test libraries for Robot Framework.http://robotframework.org/

	- Earlier programming experience is expected but not absolutely necessary.http://diveintopython.net/

	- The main study material for this training is the excellent Dive Into Python book which is freely available for on-line reading, 
	  downloading or printing from http://diveintopython.net. It is targeted for people who already know how to program but do not know
	  Python before.

	- If you are a novice programmer, it might better to start with Think Python book. 
	  http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html
	  It is also available for free and its target audience is people without any earlier programming knowledge.

	- Python Tutorial, available at http://python.org and included in the standard Python installation at least on Windows, 
	  is also very good. Some of the sections in this training refer to it instead of or in addition to Dive Into Python.

	- Python coding style guidelines are specified in PEP-8. Notice that the Dive Into Python book uses camelCaseStyle instead of 
	  the recommended underline_style.

	- Another highly recommended style guide, covering many essential Python idioms and techniques, is Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python available at http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html

	- The official Python website at http://python.org is a good place to find more documentation and Python related information 
	  in general.

	- If you need information about Jython, the Java implementation of Python, you can start from http://jython.org.
	
	- The Definitive Guide to Jython covers Jython in detail and is useful especially if you are interested about Jython-Java integration. 
	  It is freely available at http://jythonbook.com.
