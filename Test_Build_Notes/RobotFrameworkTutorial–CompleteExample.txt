I.  Robot Framework Tutorial – Overview
 a. What means keyword-driven testing?
	Whenever I try to explain what a keyword is, I refer to it as a function or method that can be used to test (or help test) 
	one (smaller or bigger) aspect of the SuT (“System under Test”, that is how we call the tested system to be a bit more cool ;-)).

	The really cool – and really powerful – thing about this now is that one keyword can be defined from other keywords and so on. 
	That is why we are often talking of:

	Higher-level keywords: 
	Those are really testing a concrete aspect of the business logic of the system under test.

	Lower-level keywords: 
	To keep the implementation of the higher-level keywords at a decent size one is often breaking down the required 
	functionality to several lower-level keywords.

	Technical keywords: 
	Those provide the technical implementation to access and thus test the system.
	
	Keyword,,Test Function 1''
	|   Input: A,B,C
	|   Expected Result: X
	|
	|--> Keyword,,Update Input Table''
	|		Input: A,B,C
	|		Expected Result: ok/nok
	|               |		
	|               |--> Keyword..Connect To DB''
	|               |       Input: Connection-String
	|               |       Expected Result: ok/nok
	|               |
	|               |-->  Keyword,,Insert To Table''
	|               |       Input: Table-Name,x
	|               |       Expected Result: ok/nok
	|               |
	|               |--> ...
	|
	|--> Keyword,,Execute Batch''
	|      Input:Process-Name
	|      Expected Result: ok/nok
	|
	|--> Keyword,,Check Result''
	       Input: x
	       Expected Result: ok/nok
	       
	technical keywords are written in any programming language (ok, not really any)
	other keywords are then written as a combination of already existing keywords	
	look at a concrete definition of some keyword:
	       __________________________________________________________________________________
	       | Google Search    | [Arguments]        | ${SEARCH_ARG}        | ${RESULT_ARG}    |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|
	       |                  | Input Text         | q                    |  ${SEARCH_ARG}   |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|
	       |                  | Sleep              | 2s                   |                  |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|
	       |                  | Click Button       | btnG                 |  don't wait      |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|	       
	       |                  |Page should contain | ${RESULT_ARG}        |                  |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|
	       |                  |Capture Screenshot  |                      |                  |
	       |__________________|____________________|______________________|__________________|	 	       

	This shows:
		- definition of a keyword for a Google Search 
		- using keywords from the Selenium Library
	This leads us to the fact that there are already a lot of predefined keywords defined in so called Test Libraries.

 b.	Installation of Robot Framework 
 	- get the core framework and a set of Standard Test Libraries, bundled with the core installation
    - Standard Test Libraries and a lot of additional external Test Libraries
      contributed by the Robot Framework community and serve different purposes
    - good thing on all this libraries 
       you can mix all the keywords from all the different libraries together in defining your own keywords
       you can for example easily write tests for a web application using keywords from the Selenium Library 
       to remote control the web frontend and use at the same time the Database Library to check results of certain 
       operations from the database
    - ideal case all this can be done without a need to do any “real coding”, but by combining existing keywords from 
      existing libraries to high-level keywords

Z.  Python Robot Framework Tutorial (This is primarily a Python Tutorial)

1) Introduction	
	- This is self learning material to learn how to program using Python language.http://python.org/
	  The target is to learn enough Python to be able to start creating test libraries for Robot Framework.http://robotframework.org/

	- Earlier programming experience is expected but not absolutely necessary.http://diveintopython.net/

	- The main study material for this training is the excellent Dive Into Python book which is freely available for on-line reading, 
	  downloading or printing from http://diveintopython.net. It is targeted for people who already know how to program but do not know
	  Python before.

	- If you are a novice programmer, it might better to start with Think Python book. 
	  http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html
	  It is also available for free and its target audience is people without any earlier programming knowledge.

	- Python Tutorial, available at http://python.org and included in the standard Python installation at least on Windows, 
	  is also very good. Some of the sections in this training refer to it instead of or in addition to Dive Into Python.

	- Python coding style guidelines are specified in PEP-8. Notice that the Dive Into Python book uses camelCaseStyle instead of 
	  the recommended underline_style.

	- Another highly recommended style guide, covering many essential Python idioms and techniques, is Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python available at http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html

	- The official Python website at http://python.org is a good place to find more documentation and Python related information 
	  in general.

	- If you need information about Jython, the Java implementation of Python, you can start from http://jython.org.
	
	- The Definitive Guide to Jython covers Jython in detail and is useful especially if you are interested about Jython-Java integration. 
	  It is freely available at http://jythonbook.com.
